Problem Solving:

* "Modelling.ipynb" contains the EDA, Feature Engineering & Model Building and the explanations.

* "DS_ML Coding Challenge Dataset - Training Dataset.csv" is the Train Dataset.


* "DS_ML Coding Challenge Dataset - Test Dataset.csv" is the Test Dataset.

Tried 3 approaches - Random Forest, XG Boost and Artificial Neural Network model.

XGBoost is my final approach. All explanations inside the notebook.
